                    <p>When we install a new application on a computer, it is often necessary to reboot the system. This happens because the computer cannot handle files while being used (by the operating system or other programs). These files (thoughts, ideas) need to be released from old programs so new ones can be created.</p>
<p>The Reboot festival aims to break free from the art/science dichotomy, the idea that science and art are opposed, and drive transdisciplinary digital creativity. We show how subjectivity, emotion, beauty, and creativity can (should?) dialogue with the scientific method’s seriousness, precision, and rigor while enriching each other.</p>
<p>To explore the idea that scientific research is not opposed to art is precisely what we want to Reboot - i.e., to disrupt from the art/science dichotomy and drive transdisciplinary digital creativity. We want to show how subjectivity, emotion, beauty, and creativity can (should?) dialogue with the seriousness, precision, and rigor of the scientific method while enriching each other.</p>
<p>The Reboot Festival is an invitation to speculation, to criticism, to a fresh scientific production, and to formal transdisciplinary artistic interventions. The festival will take place in Porto, where, in 5 days, we will “restart” all participants through an exhibition, a <a href="#doctoral-symposium">doctoral symposium</a>, keynotes, and other talks.</p>
<p>This festival is the result of a collaboration of more than 10 years between the University of Porto and the NOVA University of Lisbon, through FEUP, FCSH, and FCT schools. )</p>
<p>After a hiatus of one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Reboot festival is now returning, and <strong>this year’s topic is</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="focus" class="custom-font">Time to Reboot wellbeing - New Media Art as Therapy</h3>
<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affecting many people’s mental health, raising awareness to nurture emotional wellness has become ubiquitous and absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Leo Tolstoy once said that art &ldquo;is a means of union among men, joining them together in the same feelings, and indispensable for the life and progress toward well-being of individuals and humanity.&rdquo; More recently, Alain de Botton and John Armstrong wrote a book called &ldquo;Art as Therapy,&rdquo; where they call for the necessity to rethink the uses of art. They suggest exploring the therapeutic potential for artworks, framing them according to a psychological method that invites us to align our deeper selves with artworks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if museums were set up with emotion-galleries: of joy, love, sorrow, compassion? What if the blurbs next to the art discussed the turmoil or joys the models were experiencing rather than simply history? What if artists purposely chose positive, life-affirming themes for their work most of the time?
<br>
<em>&mdash; from Art as Therapy by Alain de Botton, John Armstrong</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This year’s edition of Reboot will feature new media artworks that can function as therapeutic tools. The galleries will be organized according to the therapeutic potential of the artworks, and visitors will be &ldquo;patients&rdquo; looking to be &ldquo;treated&rdquo; by the artworks. Artworks that inspire us to keep going when life gets tough, that remind us of the good things in life (focusing on the positive), and to practice gratitude, that instill us to connect with loved ones, that teach us to deal with loss and sadness, that provide new perspectives, and many other ideas that contribute to emotional wellbeing and more fulfilled lives.</p>
<p>The 2021 edition of the Reboot Fest  happens from November 5th to November 9th at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/KVfhc7v1Zp5mi6d47">U.Porto&rsquo;s Casa Comum</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-mask-and-the-other">The Mask and the Other</h2>
<p>The mask allows the transformation of the self into another, whether as a form of defense of emotional well-being, either as a way of dispossessing oneself, generating of an emotional reboot. This collective project, entitled The Mask and the Other, had its genesis in the transdisciplinary artistic explorations that intersect Sculpture, Multimedia and Art Theory, in the context of a degree in Visual Arts and Technologies at ESELx-IPL. We propose a video installation consisting of several screens informally arranged in the exhibition space. Installation intends stimulate intellectual questioning about the concealment/revelation that the mask provides, poetic freeing imagination, thought and senses, summoning the spectator to reimagine himself.</p>

<h2 id="study-for-a-cosmic-city">Study for a Cosmic City</h2>
<p>Study for a cosmic city is inspired by a utopian urban proposal exposed by the composer and architect Iannis Xenakis in an essay entitled &ldquo;La Ville Cosmique&rdquo; (1965). In an attempt to relate computer graphics to the formalization of sound, the structures that characterize the utopian city are designed using superquadratic curves capable of describing reasonable variations in amplitude and pitch. Parameter values extracted from buildings and paths are used to process sound materials from unidentified radio transmissions actually received worldwide. In the graphic representation, each building transmits a specific radio signal whose quality and intensity depend on the position of a cursor, also interfering with the other sound sources. On the other hand, paths on the ground define the meso- and macro-formal articulation of the audiovisual work as well as the virtual localization of the processed audio signals.</p>

<p>Ariane is a deepfake video of Ariwasabi, the world’s most famous unknown model from the stock image website Shutterstock. Billions of people see her face on a regular basis but no one knows who she is. An image ghost.
In a world where image broadcast is dictated by its usage, reality proves out to be schizophrenic. Machine learning is leading us to a future where new words can be put into speeches. Social media profile images and celebrities are transformed on to porn stars and video footage can be altered to put people in places where they never been.</p>
<p>Leading us to believe that an event occurred in order to influence the opinion and feed one new type of invisible and unknown violence.
For our pupils to get in touch with reality, which at the slightest miscalculation reveals itself to be pre-designed, eye drops are necessary.</p>

<h2 id="eco-spheres">Eco Spheres</h2>
<p>The Eco Spheres project was born within the scope of my master&rsquo;s thesis in Multimedia: Arts and Culture (FEUP): Eco Spheres: An audiovisual artistic creation in Anthropocene (Available <a href="https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/135988">here</a>. This one project intends to analyze how technology in audiovisual contexts can be allied to (re)create the necessary bonds to Nature, through artistic creation with and for a specific natural space. It&rsquo;s an almost therapeutic artistic approach to introspective reflection, but also an invitation to meditate on the individual and their inclusion in the natural world.</p>

<p><strong>Ana Carvalho dos Santos</strong>. 1996, Porto.
Graduated in Multimedia from the Superior School of Art and Design (2018), master in Multimedia: Arts and Culture, by the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (2021). Her work is essentially focused on the production of digital audiovisual works, unfolding between installation, performance, visual and sound art. Currently she has artistically explored issues that address dichotomies of the real and imaginary, concrete and abstract, as well as the distortion and perception of objects and sensations real and mental. Nature appears as an object of study and an ally in artistic practice, in particular in his latest Eco Spheres project, started at the end of 2020 and constantly under construction. In this on the making project, he explores the possibilities of artistic creation, in special using digital, to foster environmental awareness and awareness in the it was from the Anthropocene. Between 2018 and 2019 she worked at RUM: Rádio Universitária do Minho and currently works at Imaginando (Braga).</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a Visual Artist and mainly known as a pioneer of Artificial Intelligence usage in arts, even if I work as well with classic Digital Art, Photography, NFT and Video Art. Most people noticed my work when I created some years ago the world‘s first film with an AI-generated actress, the retro-futuristic short film „Un‘emozione per sempre 2.0“ (see IMDb).</p>
<p>Born in 1985 I am part of a generation of transformation toward the digital. The acting at the
borderline of art and technology results that my art projects are quoted by the tech institutions
like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, “Collective Wisdom”, 2019), and as well I am invited to classic art events, for example to a Biennale in Italy, and to Art Meets Tech festivals like “The New Art Fest Lisbon 2020” or some days ago to the Intervalsfest, Nizhny Novgorod. Novgorod, Russia.</p>
<p>At the end of October 2021 my video artwork Galão - Dreaming of Lisbon will be presented at
the International İKÇÜ ART FESTIVAL of the Faculty of Art and Design of the Izmir Katip Celebi
University, Turkey. Currently DancesCubesII is officially selected for the exhibition project
Change21 of the ARTWEEK in Mykolaiv, Ukraine. My understanding of art started when I worked extensively with intelligent machines and algorithms, understood them – and started then to understand us, the humans&hellip; and their human entity which is simultaneously the source of their greatest strength and their greatest weakness.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>The Digital Media Doctoral Symposium (DMDS) provides an opportunity for the Digital Media Ph.D. students and Ph.D. Students of other doctoral programs to present and discuss their ongoing Ph.D. research work (e.g., research goals, preliminary ideas, research plan, initial/intermediate results), with experts in the field and peers. Students will receive feedback on the quality of their presentation and on the proposed research itself.</p>
<p>Integrated with Reboot, the doctoral symposium includes lecture sessions with keynote speakers with relevant scientific contributions in the field of Digital Media, as well as presentations by doctoral studens in the same area. Therefore, the doctoral symposium opens the door to a space that encourages discussion, sharing, and networking. On the one hand, it draws inspiration from the works exhibited at Reboot and, on the other, from the current and innovative lectures given by keynote speakers, as well as from ideas and preliminary works by doctoral students.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation Title:</strong> Digital Storytelling: Sharing Stories as Legacy<br>
<strong>Summary:</strong> A digital story is a powerful artifact to communicate an older person’s legacy, and it is also a comfortable approach to learning new technologies. In this conversation, we explore the primary types of stories that people choose to leave as their legacy digital stories and how digital media can promote the well-being of older adults.</p>

Michel van Dartel (b. 1976) is Director of V2_Lab for the Unstable Media and Research Professor at the Avans Centre of Applied Research for Art, Design and Technology (CARADT). He holds an MSc in cognitive psychology and a PhD in artificial intelligence.
Alongside his work at CARADT and V2_, Michel also acts as an advisor and independent curator. Michel also is a manuscript reviewer for conferences and journals</p>
<p><strong>Presentation Title:</strong> The situated turn in art and design<br>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Humans are inseparable from the world around them. Yet time and again, human-oriented research and development considers them in isolation from their surroundings. This is particularly true in the domains of art and design, where convention has it that work is produced in studios and experienced in the sterile environs of art and design venues. In this lecture, Michel van Dartel will show that the stakes involved in this isolation are higher than they may appear at first glance. Connecting ideas from fields ranging from cognitive science to avant-garde art and design history, he argues that we need to consider aesthetics “in the wild” if we are to respond to this exigency.</p>
