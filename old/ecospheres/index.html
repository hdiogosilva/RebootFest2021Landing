<p><strong>Ana Carvalho dos Santos</strong>. 1996, Porto.
Graduated in Multimedia from the Superior School of Art and Design (2018), master in Multimedia: Arts and Culture, by the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (2021). Her work is essentially focused on the production of digital audiovisual works, unfolding between installation, performance, visual and sound art. Currently she has artistically explored issues that address dichotomies of the real and imaginary, concrete and abstract, as well as the distortion and perception of objects and sensations real and mental. Nature appears as an object of study and an ally in artistic practice, in particular in his latest Eco Spheres project, started at the end of 2020 and constantly under construction. In this on the making project, he explores the possibilities of artistic creation, in special using digital, to foster environmental awareness and awareness in the it was from the Anthropocene. Between 2018 and 2019 she worked at RUM: Rádio Universitária do Minho and currently works at Imaginando (Braga).</p>
