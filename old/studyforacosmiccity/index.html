        <p>Study for a cosmic city is inspired by a utopian urban proposal exposed by the composer and architect Iannis Xenakis in an essay entitled &ldquo;La Ville Cosmique&rdquo; (1965). In an attempt to relate computer graphics to the formalization of sound, the structures that characterize the utopian city are designed using superquadratic curves capable of describing reasonable variations in amplitude and pitch. Parameter values extracted from buildings and paths are used to process sound materials from unidentified radio transmissions actually received worldwide. In the graphic representation, each building transmits a specific radio signal whose quality and intensity depend on the position of a cursor, also interfering with the other sound sources. On the other hand, paths on the ground define the meso- and macro-formal articulation of the audiovisual work as well as the virtual localization of the processed audio signals.</p>

<p><strong>Julian Scordato</strong> is a composer and media artist who works mainly with sound and graphics. He studied composition and electronic music at the Conservatory of Venice and sound art at the University of Barcelona. Co-founder of the Arazzi Laptop Ensemble, he has performed live electronics both in group formations and as a solo. As a technologist, Scordato has written articles and presented results related to interactive systems for music performance and graphic notation in conferences and masterclasses. He currently works as a professor of electroacoustic music composition at the Conservatory of Padua and coordinator of SaMPL – Sound and Music Processing Lab. His award-winning electroacoustic and audiovisual works have been performed and exhibited in international festivals and institutions including Venice Biennale, Institute of Contemporary Arts (London), Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona, Prague Quadrennial of Performance Design and Space, Electronic Language International Festival (Sao Paulo), Cervantes Institute (Rio de Janeiro), International Image Festival (Manizales), Gaudeamus Music Week (Utrecht), Centre for Contemporary Arts (Glasgow), Sonorities Festival (Belfast), Art &amp; Science Days (Bourges), Athens Digital Arts Festival, ZKM Center for Art and Media (Karlsruhe), Kochi-Muziris Biennale, Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (Stanford), and New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival.</p>
